Description: Bag of Little Bootstraps (blb) allows users to utilize bootstrapping to create regression models, specifically linear regression
  models or logistic regression models. Users are also given the option to use more than one CPU when fitting a model to the data. Note,
  if users wish to utilize this parallelization feature, they first must run furrr::plan(multisession, worker = cl) in the console (cl being
  the number of CPU's they wish to use.)
